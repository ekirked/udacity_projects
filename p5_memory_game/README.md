# Concentration

This is a browser-based version of the classic card game, updated with a sleek, modern design that's responsive for mobile or desktop play.


## Game play

There are sixteen cards in the deck, each bearing one of eight designs. Click on a card to flip it over, and then click on a second card to see if it matches. Try and remember the location of each card to match the entire deck in as few moves as possible!


## Libraries

This game is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. It uses CSS animations from the [transit.js](https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit) library built by Rico Sta. Cruz and alert dialog styling with [sweetalert.js](https://github.com/t4t5/sweetalert).
